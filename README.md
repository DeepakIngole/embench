# embench
Benchmarking suite for comparing embedded optimization and MPC software

To run the chain-of-masses example from MATLAB, follow these steps:

 - **IPOPT**:
 add the CasADi root folder to the path
 - **FalcOpt**:
 add the FalcOpt root folder and the CasADi root folder to the path
 - **VIATOC**:
 compile 'viatoc.cpp' and run, copy 'make_viatoc.m', 'viatoc_run_sim.slx', and 'NMPCProblem_S_wrapper.cpp' to the '_viatoc' folder and run 'make_viatoc'. Warning: the autogenerated 'NMPCProblem_S_wrapper.cpp' is wrong, use the one mentioned above.
 - **ACADO**:
 run 'make.m' in 'ACADOToolkit/interfaces/matlab', this automatically adds ACADO to your path
 - **GRAMPC**:
 add 'GRAMPC/matlab/mfiles' to your path
 - **acados**:
 make sure '+acados' and the acados libraries are in your path, as well as CasADi

To replicate plots:

 - run 'plot_results.m'.
